          <firstletter>F</firstletter>all is a time to rejoice the cycle of life coming to an end in nature
    and the anticipation of new life.  Leaves fall with the hope of new ones
    soon to take their place. The weather is cool and comfortable. The type
    of weather to be able to blissfully work in the yard trimming trees, raking
    leaves, and doing minor repairs to the exterior of the house. You chat with 
    the neighbors as you lean on your rake.  You are comfortable - neither too 
    hot or too cold.  You take a walk and feel the crunch of leaves under your 
    sneakers.  You contemplate if the coming winter will be a bad or mild one
    but for now you enjoy the coolness of the air and the wonderful autumn
    colors surrounding you.

        with hot chocolate and ginger snaps in front of a roaring fireplace
        with frends and family. But, at some point, we have to leave the warmth
        our homes and venture outside to shovel out our vehicles and shovel paths
        to the street and to the mailbox.  Our arms ache, our cheeks are cold, our 
        mittens get wet and we long for the spring. Then we see our dog frolicking
        in the snow and our children building a snow fort and we remember what
        we love about winter - the pureness of the snow, the romping in the snow,
        the quietness and cleanliness of the new fallen snow, the crispness in 
        the air.  And, all of sudden, thoughts of moving to Florida are gone 
        and you make a snowball and throw it at your neighbor.</b>

<b><firstletter>S</firstletter>pring is here. The days are growing longer. Spring jackets substitute for winter coats. Away
    with gloves, mittens, earmuffs, hats and bulky sweaters. We are reborn. Look
    around - the flowers are bursting through the ground, the trees are budding,
    the grass is greener. The lawnmower needs a tune up. Trips to the nursery become
    a weekly ritual. Checking out vegetable seeds online. Walks become longer as
    the air is pleasant and the sun is warm. Spring has arrived in all its glory. 
    Looking forward to experiencing nature's new beginnings. </b>

    heading to the beach, hiking and camping in the woods, sitting in the
    sun reading a book, working the garden, lazing around with the dog, 
    eating ice cream and lobster rolls, welcoming the cool breezes of the
    night and basking in the warmth of the sun are all favorite Summer
    activities. The long days of the summer quickly pass by and soon it will
    be time to leave it all behind as Fall moves in and the cycle of life
    begins once again. But for a short 2-3 months the outdoors can be totally
    enjoyed without needing a jacket. Be sure to wear sunglasses to protect 
    eyes and apply sunscreen lotion as needed. The sun can be a dangerous
    beast and should be respected.

<h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
<!--Note the reuse of the fall class.-->
<p id="bestseason" class="fall">
    <first-line>The best of all the four seasons is FALL. </first-line>
    Fall does not signify the end of life in nature; it signifies the order
    of life in nature and the promise of a new beginning. Fall strengthens
    us to prepare for winter and gives us hope that new beginnings will
    always return. It's the cycle of life.</p>
